# Chris's Album

Thanks to COVID, I've had the time to finally get round to digitising all those old videos and cassette tapes!  

I realised as I was recording the videos that there may be a higher quality video file out there in the internet somewhere.  So I went hunting.

As you'll see, I found some decent quality videos, although the forgiegn subtitles are hints of the video's exotic origin.


## 1970's
You can find Dutches of Duke Street on DVD.  Unfortunately I have not been able to find much of 
The Regiment.
