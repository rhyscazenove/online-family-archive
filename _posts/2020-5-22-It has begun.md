Wow well here it is!

Did not plan to make a site when I started this project, but as the amount of content grew, I felt that a simple listing of videos would not suffice, and that a little more narrative would help people work their way through the collection.

FOr the technical setup, I did something new.  This is basically a static blog site, and I wanted to miniise my costs without being too dependednt on other services I use.  So I deceided to piggyback on my github account and do this vis gitHub pages and Jekyll.  I have to say it was easier than I was expecting, and pretty flexible, so I am happy with that decision.

When looking at the settings, I discovered that I could attach a domain name to it, I decided upon 'online family archive dot com' as an easy to remember yet discrete domain name that will prevent this from appearing is search engines.

Talking of which, although this is technically a public web site, it is not intended to be a public memorial for either of my parents.  Anyone is welcome, but it is intedned for friends and family.
