Welcome to Angharad's selected works page.  This is not an exahustive list of her work - please take a look at [her imdb page](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0715878/) for full details.

### Highlights

There's quite a lot here, so here are some ways to work through it.

*The Essentials*  [Welsh Greats (2010)](#welshgreats), [Poldark (1974)](#poldark), [Joes Ark (1974)](#joesark),  [Under Milk Wood (1972)](#undermilkwood), [Hands of The Ripper (1971)](#handsoftheripper).

*The Poldark Set*  [Poldark (1976)](#poldark), [Morcambe & Wise (1976)](#morcambe), [Cult of Poldark (2002)](#cultofpoldark)

*Under Milk Wood* [Under Milk Wood (1972)](#undermilkwood), [Southbank Show (1998)](#southbank), [Dylan on Dylan (2002)](#dylanondylan)

*Something funny?*  Angharad did quite a bit of light comedy in the early 70s.  Some of the humour has aged better than others, but it is all fascinating! [Catch Me A Spy (1971)](#catchmeaspy), [Doctors in Charge (1972)](#doctorsincharge)

*Something for the kids?* [British Folk Tales (1980)](#middleenglish) is great, and the two Call My Bluff Shows ([1980](#callmybluff1980) and [1996](*#callmybluff1996)) are entertaining.


# Selected works, by year

*1968*{:.year}  An amazing early-career non-speaking park in **The Avengers** TV Show.  Only appearing in one shot, but what an amazing composition that literally puts her in the center of the frame.  The episode itself is quite sureal, with Steed being replaced by a doppleganger. I've only been able to [find this one on iTunes](https://tv.apple.com/us/episode/they-keep-killing-steed/umc.cmc.13m8ip6x4rphb0wr4dqu2wn7s?showId=umc.cmc.11q3yqne3abpwkdxrrstnorx1), so you'll have to purchase it there if you want to see it. 

*1969*{:.year}<a name="doctorinthehouse"></a> The earliest recording I could find is from 1969, a tv comedy show called **Doctor in the House** [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_in_the_House_(TV_series)){:.wiki-link}.  Silly fun swinging sixties kind of stuff.  And lovely surprise - my uncle Mike Grady is in it too!.

*1971*{:.year}<a name="handsoftheripper"></a> **Hands of the Ripper**, with Eric Porter [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hands_of_the_Ripper){:.wiki-link}.  As I grew up mum was quite ashamed / embarraseed that she was in a gruesome horror movie.  She banned me and Linford from seeing it.  As I write this, I still haven't seen it!  But I plan to - it now enjoys a successful cult following within the horror community.  They recently remastered it and released it blueray with an audio interview with mum... I must check it out....

I don't need to say anything about this, as there is so much out there.  The dvds are still widely available, so I highly recommend you buy or borrow them to watch.  However, if you just wanted to watch one epsiode, then arguably the first episode of the second season is a great taste of the characters and the story...
